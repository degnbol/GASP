2-Methyl-umbelliferone	5280567		2-methyl doesn't seem to exist and it says 4-methyl in the GT Predict paper so it is a typo

a-cyano-4-hydroxyl-cinnamic acid	5328791		a-cyano-4-hydroxyl-cinnamic acid
Trans-Zentin-Glucose	9842892		from GT-Predict. They only refer to Trans-Zeatin in paper. Zentin searches gives no results except zentinic and trans-Zeatin-Glucosid is on pubchem.

UDP5SGlc	8629		I think based on looking at the GT-Predict paper that this is just UDP-glucose bound at a 5S location 
dTDPXyl	122707150		best match but doesn't seem like a perfect match?

3.4-hydroxycinnamic acid	689043		Seeing differing value between this and 4-hydroxycinnamic acid for OleD made me realize the 3. matters. Looking in GTPredict_All_Data/Extension--Berry\ dataset/Predict_Lycium_GT1s_GT-Predict.xlsx there is mention of "3,4-dihyroxy cinnamic acid" so that is obviously what is meant.
