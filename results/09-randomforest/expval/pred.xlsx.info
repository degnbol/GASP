Tables containing reactivity prediction scores calculated from randomforest runs.
The next table is a list of selected sequence features used in some of the runs.

Legend:
chem	acceptors that have been experimentally tested are the acceptor testset
seqs	enzymes that have been experimentally tested are the sequence testset
match	onehot aka. sparse encoding of amino acids
speciesSeqSelect	instead of using all sequence features (default) only a subset if used based on a feature selection run where training data was split by species.
