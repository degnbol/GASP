Looking at the roc curves we see that the curve with best accuracy among top scored data points is using species feature selection.
The sequence features are selected with 3 groups of species, At, Zn, and others. They are selected with best average group AUC and also my custom top heavy metric.
This is not about overall performance (AUC) but performance if we were to select top n candidates.
